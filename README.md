# Pedestrian Traffic Light Control
A little project I did to simulate traffic light control for a simple Pedestrian Crossing on a Major road.
I provided code for replicating it with an Arduino or a PIC16F877A MCU 
In the arduino code I added Two 7-segment displays to help count down for a pedestrian that wants to cross. Read the code comments for more info 

Mode of Operation:   

A pedestrian crossing from any of the sides of the road will hit a switch located at the pedestrian crossing. This then controls the Vehicle Traffic Lights (which are on both sides on the road) to stop cars from moving (shows RED) then Pedestrian light shows a GREEN allowing the pedestrian to cross.



Improvement:   

For a real Pedestrian traffic light system, you can add cameras or sensors to check traffic density or the number of pedestrians willing to cross. Efficient algorithms can be used to minimize time wasted, traffic and identify emergencies.
