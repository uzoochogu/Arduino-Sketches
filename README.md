# Pedestrian Traffic Light Control
A little project I did to simulate traffic light control for a simple Cross Junction.
I provided code for replicating it with an Arduino or a PIC16F877A MCU 
In the arduino code I added Two 7-segment displays to help count down for a pedestrian that wants to cross. Everything in explained in the comments
